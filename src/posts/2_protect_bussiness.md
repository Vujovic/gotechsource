When part of your business is importing goods manufactured in China, it is crucial to ensure quality control. Even the best factories with an excellent organization are not always able to produce a perfect series of products.

Therefore, preparing a comprehensive quality control plan for products manufactured in China should ensure that each order is in accordance with your specifications and expected quality.

Read below what quality control is and how to protect your business.

## What is quality control?

Quality control may refer to the product specification or production process. The goal of quality control is to identify any problem, lack, and mismatch on products that do not follow the required specification from the buyer or generally international standards.

Getting goods from China is always a challenge, it does not matter how long you are doing it. Quality control is key to protecting your business whether it’s the first order or repeatedly processed orders. Not only can that help you avoid defective goods and similar mistakes in the future, but it also helps you get the order on time. For those reasons, for quality control, you should select experts who have many years of experience working with Chinese manufacturers.

Engagement of a third party for the controller is a flexible and reliable choice for small and medium enterprises, it saves you time and money.

Of course, you can decide to set up your own quality control team. This strategy requires intense training on the ordering products, plus local resources that should be available for translation and communication with a new vendor. The cost of transportation and accommodation of your team during your stay in China is unavoidable.

As an alternative, there is a wide range of renowned companies that provide quality control services that are actually representing your company in China. The sole purpose of the company is to protect you and your financial interests and check the goods based on your instructions. They have a neutral relationship with suppliers and traders, in fact, their interest is to support only one side – buyers, because buyers are their clients.

The prices of services of quality control companies vary but in any case, they are much lower and more cost-effective than taking the risk of delivery goods without any inspection.

## What should be included in quality control?

When you work with a third party, a quality controller or your own team, the process is very detailed and specific to your product. You are developing a detailed control protocol based on the list of items to be checked to be in line with the product specification and the quality requirements.

The quality control on-site implies a variety of quality certifications including the outer appearance of the product, the verification of functionality that complies with your precisely defined requirements.

Anything that you miss to define in the requirements will leave the manufacturer and the controller to make judgments about how they want in accordance with their logic, which does not necessarily mean that it matches yours.

To get the best results, it would be best to provide a sample of products to the controller who will use it for reference.
