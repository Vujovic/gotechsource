This question occurs very often and I don’t see many importers who manage to solve this problem when it appears. They mainly negotiate with the contractor and very often their problem is not resolved.

More specifically, this situation occurs when random inspections of goods (pre-shipment inspections) are carried out only after production. Inspection indicated that a significant percentage of goods are defective. Very often, manufacturers will not accept your proposal to rework goods because the goods are already packed and would cost too much.

From the one side, the manufacturer is waiting for his money, while on the other side, the customer is waiting for his perfect product. Very often the time is against the importer who usually has already agreed on deadlines with his clients. In the end, the importer will have to give up on this game, pay the goods, and be sure that the buyer’s customer will not notice all the shortcomings of the goods.

## Firstly, you need to understand how the manufacturer thinks!

You need to put yourself in the position of the manufacturer. The manufacturer receives a 30% payment to start production. With a 30% deposit in hand, it can hardly cover the costs of suppliers (materials, components, packaging). In order to earn a profit, he must add about 20-30% of the margin, and he can only get profit after receiving the full payment. It is still not advantageous if it is not paid and they don't send the goods to the customer.

## What is actually happening

Most commonly purchased products are OEM products that are also purchased by other customers around the world. Importers are mainly looking for small pricing (special packaging, brand name label…) which is pretty cheap.

If the importer orders goods and pays 30% of the deposit and ultimately refuses to receive goods, the manufacturer stays with the goods, that need to be sold out as soon as possible. For storage, the goods would cause additional costs to manufacturers and that is not a good solution.

## There are two possible solutions for manufacturers

- The manufacturer will sell the products on the Chinese market as their own or will place them on a parallel market or in some cases on the black market.

- The producer will repackage and modify the products as much as he can and continue to resell them to another customer.

## Prepare the field

In order to be ready to accept your conditions, there are a few tricks. You need to know that the manufacturer will not listen to you too much if he thinks they can repackage or just slightly change their product and resell it to someone else. Therefore, if you want to have control over the manufacturer, you should have a strategy.

## Reinforce the field

Your contract (which should be bilingual) should indicate that in the case of defective goods or any other case, the manufacturer can not resell the product using your brand, regardless of the market. Customize your product to the maximum so you can not easily resell the product to someone else:

- The package is fully customized (and if possible more expensive, so it would be a great disadvantage to reject it),

- Mark as many parts of your product as possible (if it’s possible to do so and that features are not portable, wisely select high-quality ink),

- The plastic part of the mold features with your brand in 3D,

- Mark the PCB with your brand on it and customize the user interface with your brand on it, warranty label,

- Be sure that you have completely customized the packaging and the product so that it is difficult and costly to change them again,

- Negotiate patiently.

If you already come into the situation that in the pre-shipment inspection and discover product malfunctions, ask the manufacturer for a discount or to process products. In the interview, kindly point out that you understand their position, but that the contract is signed in Chinese and that your goods can not be resold to anyone else, because your brand and logo are present everywhere, too much time and money would be taken if they wanted to make changes. In this case, the option to process only defective products in a few days and deliver them to you will be more acceptable.

## Conclusion

Predict potential problems before they occur. Try to take all reasonable precautions and do not wait for the final inspection to check the condition at the factory.
